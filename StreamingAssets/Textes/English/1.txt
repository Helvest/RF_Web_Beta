Gideon, is that your dad?


[Gideon]

HELLO SIR, I AM JUST PICKING GIDEON UP FOR THE DAY!


[Bud]
IS THAT A GIRL’S VOICE?!


[CHARF Gideon change Anxious]
On second thought, I’ll come with you. Just as long as it’s far, far away and we don’t come back for a couple of hours.


[CHARF Pacifica change happy]
Sure! I’ll take you someplace that’ll blow your mind…


[CHARF change Idle]
Yeah, whatever. Let’s just get out of here first.

Sooo, your dad seemed like a really nice guy!
Why did we have to leave so fast?


[CHARF Gideon change Anxious]
Ah… He can just get a little... weird, about… Surprise guests.
You… eh, should call before you come over next time.


[CHARF Pacifica change disappointed]
Oh…


[CHARF Gideon change embarrassed]
Ahem… So where are we going?
Please don’t tell me you just found some rare bird’s nest or something weird…


[CHARF Pacifica change Happy]
Pfft! Who do you think I am? No, no. I have something far better.


[CHARF Gideon change Anxious]
I’m getting worried…


[CHARF change Happy]
Did you eat breakfast?


[CHARF Gideon change Confused]
Of course not! It’s really early!


[CHARF Pacifica change perplexed]
It’s actually 10 am… But your answer was perfect!


[CHARF Gideon change confused]
Wait a minute… Are you taking me out for breakfast?


[Pacifica] Pacifica change excited]
Hehe, yep! And here we are!
By the way, did you know that this place has the most amazing pancakes…?
Melting chocolate chip bliss, with a fresh drop of whipped cream and a juicy cherry on top…
