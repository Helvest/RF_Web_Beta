[voice host-02]
Welcome to the Reverse Falls questions and answers video!
[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-03]
I am your host for today’s Q&A, the Xbox Fridge. 
[voice host-04]
I am a voice actor for the game, however I am not allowed to disclose with you right now. But, I will be giving out teeny-tiny hints throughout this entire session.
[CHARF Xbox set happy]
[voice host-05]
So, let us bring out our participants for today’s Q&A! Starting off with Aki . . .

[CHARF Aki set happy show from outright flip]
[voice aki-01]
Hello! I’m Aki, I play Pacifica. That’s all you need to know about me, yeah.
[CHAR hide Aki]

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-06]
Uh, okay . . . Ethan?

[CHARF Ethan set idle show from outright flip]
[voice ethan-01]
Hello! Uh, I’m Ethan. I play Dipper, and I’m really excited to be here!
[CHAR hide Ethan]

[CHARF Xbox]
[voice host-07]
Thank you. And for our Voice Director, Rune?

[CHARF Rune set happy show from outright]
[voice rune-01]
Hi, I’m Rune, and I’m the voice director. So I organize all the voices.
[CHAR hide Rune]

[CHARF Xbox]
[voice host-08]
Um . . . Morgan?

[CHARF Morgan set happy show from outright]
[voice morgan-01]
Hello. I’m Morgan. And not only am I the music director, I play the alcoholic father of Gideon, Bud, and also the narrator.
[CHAR hide Morgan]

[CHARF Xbox]
[voice host-09]
And . . . Grig.

[CHARF Grig set happy show from outright]
[voice grig-01]
Yo, I’m Grig! I do general writing, directing. It’s the work.
[CHAR hide Grig]

[CHARF Xbox]
[voice host-10]
Alright, so for everyone, um . . . 
[voice host-11]
So what have you been doing so far for this project?

[CHARF Grig set sheepish show from outright]
[voice grig-02]
Ooh, a big question. Uh . . .
[voice grig-03]
I guess I can start?
[CHARF Grig set happy]
[voice grig-04]
For this project, I’ve been basically managing the writing team and ensuring we have a cohesive story going forward, and that the different teams are communicating with the writers, and that we . . . make sure the ideas we have are on the same level. Or at least try to, it’s not always super easy.
[CHAR hide Grig]

[CHARF Morgan set serious show]
[voice morgan-02]
In the music department, it’s a lot of . . . sound design, really. Figuring out where to add things or how to make things more ambient for the player, but it’s coming in nicely, as well as with adding in voices. 
[CHAR hide Morgan]

[CHARF Rune set sheepish show]
[voice rune-02]
Uh, for voice acting, I mostly just give out the lines, the voice actors do a really good job, then I usually cut them and give them to everybody else so they can put them in the game.
[CHAR hide Rune]

[CHARF Aki set happy show]
[voice aki-02]
I voice act Pacifica in the game, and I just record lines and send them to the voice acting director, yeah.
[CHAR hide Aki]

[CHARF Ethan set idle show]
[voice ethan-02]
I have yet to record lines, but I am prepping for when I eventually do.
[CHAR hide Ethan]

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-12]
Well, that’s great . . .
[CHARF Xbox set happy]
[voice host-13]
But before we begin today’s question and answers video, I just want to give a big ole thanks to Charlotte for her artwork for today. Thank you.
[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-14]
Now, let us move on to the questions for our . . . our three directors. 
[voice host-15]
Starting off with, “This is probably a question you guys get a lot, but how is the game coming along?”
[CHAR hide Xbox]

[CHARF Grig set sheepish show]
[voice grig-05]
Um, who wants to start with that one?

[CHARF Morgan set sheepish show]
[voice morgan-03]
I think it’s a difficult position to say how it is coming along [CHAR show Rune] [CHAR Rune set laugh] [CHAR Grig set smile] because there’s always more you want to add to it, but there’s also, things have been getting done, and it’s great to see it coming together as it does. 

[CHARF Rune set laugh]
[voice rune-03]
There’s a lot of moving parts, so it kinda depends on what part you’re in, haha.

[CHARF Grig set idle]
[voice grig-06]
Oh, absolutely.
[CHARF Grig set sheepish]
[voice grig-07]
Um, well I guess, we have chapter 1 written. 
[voice grig-08]
We have chapter 2 . . . basically written? Although it needs a bit of editing work. 
[CHARF Grig set embarrassed]
[voice grig-09]
A lot of editing work.
[CHARF Grig set sheepish]
[voice grig-10]
Chapter 3 is . . . sort of, a step in between the major overarching narratives, so there are multiple smaller chapters in it . . . and those are coming along well enough.
[voice grig-11]
So, it’s uh, churning.

[CHAR hide all]

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-16]
Alright, great. Now, moving on . . .
[voice host-17]
Is there an estimated release date for chapter 1?
[CHAR hide Xbox]

[wait 3]

[CHARF Grig set sheepish]
[voice grig-12]
That’s a hard-

[CHARF Morgan set laugh]
[voice morgan-04]
The silence speaks volumes.

[CHAR Grig set laugh]
[CHARF Rune set laugh]
[voice rune-04]
Yes, it does.

[CHARF Grig set sheepish]
[voice grig-13]
Uh . . . we’re working on it? We don’t really have a specific “oh it’s definitely gonna be by then.” But we do want it to come, as Helvest put it, “soon.”

[CHARF Rune set laugh]
[voice rune-05]
Soon can mean a lot of things, but yes, soon.

[CHARF Grig set sheepish]
[voice grig-14]
Yeah, soonTM. The best time.
[CHAR hide all]

[CHARF Xbox set laugh]
[voice host-18]
Let’s just say that it’ll probably be ready when it’s actually ready.

[CHARF Rune set laugh]
[voice rune-06]
Yeah.

[CHARF Xbox set smile]
[voice host-19]
Alright. 

[CHARF Grig set laugh]
[voice grig-15]
90% sure this year. 

 [CHAR Rune laugh]
 [CHAR Xbox laugh]
[voice host-20]
Good to know, good to know.
[CHAR hide Grig Rune]

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-21]
Okay, now this is probably gonna be a bit of a needy question, but I’m gonna say the entire thing, so I hope you don’t mind.
[voice host-22]
“I need to, NEED TO” - and they literally mean need to - “know if Gravity Falls characters will be connected to the Reverse Falls story and be part of it like an alternate reality meets main reality type of thing or if it's just gonna be reverse fall characters and their story.”
[voice host-23]
Um, I think what they’re trying to say is if the main universe and alternate universe are kinda, going together, in a way? If that makes sense. 

[CHARF Grig set sheepish]
[voice grig-16]
. . . Right. Oh dear.
[voice grig-17]
Uh, that’s a hard one to unpack.
[CHARF Grig set idle]
[voice grig-18]
There . . . to avoid going into, like, spoiler territory and absolutes or anything like that . . . 
[voice grig-19]
We’ve changed up how we’re publishing the story a fair few times throughout development, because, as you might imagine with a project like this, there are a lot of people who come and join, and a lot of people who leave. 
[voice grig-20]
We have all kinds of starting points and plans that get shot up and then get trashed and oh, “this sounds like a good idea, maybe we try this” and so and so forth.
[voice grig-21]
Um, one of those early ideas was a massively branching story, which, that’s incredibly ambitious, and we started out with plans to follow in that direction. 
[voice grig-22]
Which means, multiple ends were planned, or at least . . . vaguely, in a nebulous of ideas put down.
[voice grig-23]
Currently, we are following one of those plans and trying to get to at least one full storyline all the way through the game . . .
[CHARF Grig set sheepish]
[voice grig-24]
. . . and then we might add more later, if we have the will, at that distant point in the future.
[CHARF Grig set idle]
[voice grig-25]
That current path . . . does not fully, uh, emit for a lot of Reverse Falls to Gravity Falls crossover-y stuff. We’re probably just gonna be sticking with the Reverse Falls characters, and taking their story all the way through to the end. 
[CHARF Grig set smile]
[voice grig-26]
 Then maybe later we’ll add more, maybe we’ll add some, like, bonus or hidden content, or meta stuff. We’ll see, honestly.
[voice grig-27]
But as it stands, they are separate, and I hope you get to enjoy the story.
[CHAR hide Grig]

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-24]
Great, alright, let’s segway to the next question.
[voice host-25]
“How in the world did this go from a Mike Inel sketch to an actual project? I’d just like to know when you guys realized this stopped being a joke and became real.

[CHARF Aki set unclear]
[voice aki-03]
I joined like later on so I really-
[CHAR hide Aki]

[CHARF Grig set embarrassed]
[voice grig-28]
Anyone here besides me here from the start? [CHAR Xbox set laugh]

[wait 3]

[CHARF Rune set sheepish]
[voice rune-07]
Me too, I only joined more recently.
[CHAR hide Rune]

[CHARF Grig set embarrassed]
[voice grig-29]
Right . . . Uh . . .
[voice grig-30]
I will try to get my thoughts together . . . 
[voice grig-31]
Can you guys share like, how y’all ended up joining while I do that?
[CHAR hide Grig]

[CHARF Rune set laugh]
[voice rune-08]
Um, of course. 
[CHARF Rune set smile]
[voice rune-09]
Um, I accidentally found the game, and I thought it was super cool, so when I joined the Discord and found out they needed some help, I asked if I could . . .
[CHARF Rune set laugh]
[voice rune-10]
. . . and through processes, I got to be the director of the voice actors. 
 [CHAR hide Rune]

[CHARF Morgan set smile]
[voice morgan-05]
There was some word of mouth through years, and it got an artist to ask me to join the team early on. 
[voice morgan-06]
I’m not sure if chapter 0 was already released, but I was just a musician. So I was another resource waiting for stuff to do. 
[voice morgan-07]
Long time later, I was asked if I’d like to do more as somebody who knows music.
[CHAR hide Morgan]

[CHARF Aki set thinking]
[voice aki-04]
I could say how I found the project, so sure.
[voice aki-05]
I had always kinda, like, known about this project from when the first trailer came out. I just didn’t realize that it- I thought it was still going forward, I didn’t know it needed more people. 
[voice aki-06]
So I joined the discord server, and I kinda just was like, “Oh, I wanna voice act in this project, I don’t care who I get” and [CHAR Aki set happy] I got Pacifica, so, that’s fun.
[CHAR hide Aki]

[CHARF Grig set smile]
[voice grig-32]
Ethan, you wanna, add something? 

[CHARF Ethan set cheeky]
[voice ethan-03]
For sure! [CHARF Rune set laugh]
[CHAR hide Grig Rune]
[CHARF Ethan set idle]
[voice ethan-04]
Um, in all honesty, I’m pretty new to the project. I just discovered it last year.
[voice ethan-05]
I heard about it before, seen the trailer videos, but that was a long time ago, so sort of back of the mind stuff. 
[voice ethan-06]
And then, I sorta stumbled upon- uh, there was a casting call for voice actors, and because of how interested I was in the project, I just applied for everything I possibly could hoping to be involved in some capacity, and then I was really excited, and then grateful, to be able to do Dipper.
[CHAR hide Ethan]

[CHARF Xbox set smile]
[voice host-26]
I mean, yeah, that’s- that’s great.
[voice host-27]
I mean, I’m kinda in the same boat with you. I just stumbled upon the casting call online, and just put in an audition, and here we are. 
[CHAR hide Xbox]

[wait 3]

[CHARF Grig set idle]
[voice grig-33]
Everyone saw the trailer 5 years ago, I assume. 
[CHARF Grig set sheepish]
[voice grig-34]
Or at some point between five years ago and now.
[CHARF Grig set idle]
[voice grig-35]
Back then, Molechitus, uh, started out poking around in the gravity falls, reverse falls, reddit threads, and basically asked, “Hey, are there people actually interested in turning this into a legit game?” He came across Helvest, and some other people like, uh, Raether, and the Catacat. 
[voice grig-36]
Uh, and they basically began putting together a very quick demo. Um, I think the demo is still available up on Gamejolt?
[voice grig-37]
And the dialogue for that one was thrown together by Helvest, I believe, and uh, very quickly, they just put something out there to like, see okay, can we build something with this?
[voice grig-38]
From there, I joined to help with proofreading and like, doing editing, and making sure the English came across well and to translate it to 4 other languages. 
[voice grig-39]
Um, and then, we basically just, began cobbling things together. 
[CHARF Grig set sheepish]
[voice grig-40]
By some strange twist of fate, I ended up assigned the . . . writing director? On accident, I think?? Or temporarily?? And I’ve just been stuck with it sense?
[voice grig-41]
And we just sorta kept going? And the ball just kept rolling and rolling and rolling, and eventually we came here.
[voice grig-42]
It’s a little bit of an accident that happened in a discord server? That’s sorta how it came to be.
[CHAR hide all]

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-28]
Well, sometimes the best things can be just a little unexpected.
[voice host-29]
Well, okay, let’s move on to the next question here.
[voice host-30]
What - for the directors, “what is your favorite part of working on the game?”

[wait 3]

[CHARF Rune set laugh]
[voice rune-11]
I love how none of us wanna start, haha.
Um-

[CHARF Morgan set laugh]
[voice morgan-08]
I always feel like I’m going to interrupt.

[CHARF Rune set laugh]
[voice rune-12]
Me too.
[CHARF Rune set smile]
[voice rune-13]
Um . . . my part, even though I’m like a director, it’s actually pretty small, but I really like seeing the voices end up being in the demo that we directors get to see, after everyone puts them together. 
[voice rune-14]
It’s really cool to hear them actually have a conversation instead of the individual lines, so . . . I think that’s my favorite part.
[CHAR hide Rune]

[CHARF Morgan set serious]
[voice morgan-09]
I think I definitely have to agree.
[voice morgan-10]
It’s not exactly . . . the position that I’m working from that I get to have the best part of it.
[voice morgan-11]
It’s seeing the communication . . . and the dedication to the art, where we want things to sound better. Can we change it this way, this way? Or really just add something we personally have ideas for on the team.
[CHAR hide Morgan]

[CHARF Grig set idle]
[voice grig-43]
Um, for me, I guess it’s just getting to read and see and interact with everybody on the team. 
[voice grig-44]
I personally don’t do a lot of the writing, as I don’t feel particularly confident in it, so instead I get to . . . um, like help direct, answer questions, and function as a sort of information well.
[voice grig-45]
Um, what came before and seeing how it’s all grown into what it is now, and just seeing and remembering, and watching everybody around the- like, the team, just putting so much effort into something that I’ve followed for so long - that’s probably the most exciting bit. 
[CHAR hide Grig]

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-31]
Alright, next question.
[voice host-32]
“Which game engine will Reverse Falls be developed on?

[CHARF Grig set sheepish]
[voice grig-46]
Oof. 
[voice grig-47]
Uh, we don't have Helvest here; that’s a hard one to answer. 

[CHARF Rune set laugh]
[voice rune-15]
Yeah.

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-33]
Oh . . .

[CHARF Morgan set laugh]
[voice morgan-12]
Where’s my coding director when I need him? [CHAR hide Morgan] [CHAR Grig Rune Xbox set laugh]
[CHAR hide Rune Xbox]

[CHARF Grig set smile]
[voice grig-48]
Yeah, uh . . . I’m pretty sure currently we’re working on it being browser-based?
[voice grig-49]
Um, so basically anything that can have a web browser will let you play the game. 
[voice grig-50]
I think we were originally poking around in Unity? But uh, development is insanely hard and slow, especially when it’s a volunteer project and everybody is busy with their own lives.
[voice grig-51]
So we’re trying to like, release smaller bits, and then maybe eventually we’ll compilate together into a larger thing to release. 
[CHAR hide Grig]

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-34]
Alright, that makes sense - okay.
[voice host-35]
“Will Reverse Falls have a unique branch of endings dependent on our choices? If so, does this mean there will be good or bad endings, or will it all end with the same scenario?”

[CHARF Rune set laugh]
[voice rune-16]
That seems to be a lot of questions for the writing director, haha. 

[CHARF Grig set sheepish]
[voice grig-52]
Yaay.

[CHARF Xbox set laugh]
[voice host-36]
I-I don’t- this is not on me, I promise you-
[voice host-37]
I-these feel like they’re just directed to you. [CHAR Grig set laugh]

[CHARF Morgan set laugh]
[voice morgan-13]
Fortunately, some of these have come up before.

[CHARF Grig set sheepish]
[voice grig-53]
Yep. 

[CHARF Morgan set smile]
[voice morgan-14]
We mentioned it a little bit.

[CHARF Grig set sheepish]
[voice grig-54]
Uh, as I mentioned before, we originally planned for a lovely, large super branching . . . thing.
[voice grig-55]
But . . . as it stands, since development time is so slow and we really want to get something out for you guys, we’ve tried to consolidate it into one single branch that just heads all the way through.
[CHARF Grig set idle]
[voice grig-56]
In the writing team, we’re making little bits- like tiny little notes for - like here’s a hook for a divergent path, we have a tree planned out . . .
[voice grig-57]
There’s more stuff, but I don’t know if we’ll ever get around to it.
[voice grig-58]
We might do it when we- release full chapters or the entire thing, but currently nope, we’ll have one nice-
[voice grig-59]
There will be slight divergences depending on what you do but they'll be contained inside the chapter, although there are some ideas for how we might have things carry over. 
[voice grig-60]
We’ll see if we manage to get more branching stuff in, but as it stands, we’ll try to get it to you as a linear narrative as a reasonable while still having choice impacts in some narrative moments.
[CHARF Grig set sheepish]
[voice grig-61]
Bleh, sorry, I’m very verbose. 

[CHARF Xbox set smile]
[voice host-38]
Yeah, no worries, I mean like you’ve got a lot of questions down your belt right now so . . .

[CHARF Grig set embarrassed]
[voice grig-62]
Eh . . .

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-39]
Alright, this will be the final question for the directors, we’ll just need to move on to the VAs real soon.
[voice host-40]
This will be a bit of a lengthy one, right now. This is like a bit of a sing of appraisal right here for the person who put this question in. 
[voice host-41]
“So excited about this being a thing! I got a lot of questions-”
[voice host-42]
“(I am very excited for this and/or this Q&A! Don't expect you to answer them all or even at all; just asking them, because I am excited for this and if any of the questions do get answered that would be awesome! Also excited to see other people's questions and this video in general!), so I am going to get to asking!”
[voice host-43]
“To the Giddy Fresh Team, I just wanted to ask about your general progress on the visual novel, next chapter(s), and/or asset gathering?”  
[voice host-44]
“I also wanted to ask the Giddy Fresh Team (only if this question isn't spoilers though) how they go about twisting the Gravity Falls characters as their now Reverse selves?”
[CHARF Xbox set smile]
[voice host-45]
Bit of a lengthy one right there!
[CHARF Xbox set laugh]
[voice host-46]
I think this is also directed to the writing director again, yikes! 
[CHAR hide Xbox]

[CHARF Grig set idle]
[voice grig-63]
Well, actually there is some stuff there for voice actors and music stuff cause you guys do a bit of the interpreting of what the characters are like.

[CHARF Morgan set laugh]
[voice morgan-15]
And we do need assets. 

[CHARF Grig set sheepish]
[voice grig-64]
Yeah, we do need so many assets.

[CHARF Rune set laugh]
[voice rune-17]
If you’re willing to volunteer, please do!

[CHARF Grig set laugh]
[voice grig-65]
Haha . . . I think one of the major hangups right now is just art - it is a visual novel, so. 
And coders. Good god, transcoding, so slow.
[voice grig-66]
As for like, progress with chapters and stuff, I did mention that we’re like on chapter 3. Out of ten. Of the main planned line. Eh. [CHAR Rune set laugh]
[voice grig-67]
We have a lot of stuff written, um. I think Helvest calculated that we have enough stuff to publish, what is it, every two weeks for an entire year? Uh . . .

[CHARF Rune set laugh]
[voice rune-18]
If-

[CHARF Grig set laugh]
[voice grig-68]
Something like that.

[CHARF Rune set smile]
[voice rune-19]
If we’re all very productive, yes. 

[CHARF Grig set laugh]
[voice grig-69]
If we’re all magically very productive and suddenly have all of the assets available and the transcoding is done like that.

[CHARF Morgan set smile]
[voice morgan-16]
And we all have the free time to do all of these things. [CHAR Grig set sheepish] [CHAR Rune set laugh]
[CHAR hide Grig]

[CHARF Xbox set laugh]
[voice host-47]
Ohh, yeah.
[CHAR hide Xbox]

[CHARF Morgan set smile]
[voice morgan-17]
Fortunately, in sound design it’s a little bit like catching feathers on one side, but unfortunately the other side is bowling balls.
[voice morgan-18]
When we have sound effects, those are things, as we get the idea, find a vast library of so many different similar sounds, and you can take your pick, which can be a little time consuming if you’re into it.
[voice morgan-19]
And then on the other side, creating songs from thin air, is something going back and forth between musicians, and really having the inspiration for it till the assets come along.

[CHARF Rune set smile]
[voice rune-20]
Um, with the voice acting, most of the main characters have been cast, of course, but we have so many side characters that only have a few lines each.
[voice rune-21]
So even though we do have a lot of people who have auditioned, I would love for more people to join so that we have a very large range of voices to use.
[voice rune-22]
That’d be very nice.

[CHARF Grig set idle]
[voice grig-70]
Mm. 
[voice grig-71]
As for the whole of twisting Gravity Falls characters into Reverse Falls characters . . .
[voice grig-72]
We look a lot at the existing Reverse Falls community, and then like, pick and choose, “oh hey this bit is interesting” or “oh, this thing looks cool.” 
[voice grig-73]
And then just try and make a character that fits the narrative we’re trying to tell, and then go from there.

[CHARF Rune set smile]
[voice rune-23]
Yeah . . . and-
[voice rune-24]
I’m usually the one who has to interpret what the writers send for the characters, including the voice actors themselves.
[voice rune-25]
So . . . it- it’s usually just like, the writers make a really good point to show how they might act or sound, so I just sort of- add a little bit more details about where there might be a pause . . .
[voice rune-26]
Or have them be a bit more happy than usual, if it comes to Pacifica - she’s a very bubbly person - and then with like, Gideon, we sort of have him be more depressed.
[CHAR hide all]

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-48]
Well, thank you directors for answering the questions I have given you.
[voice host-49]
Now, let’s move on to the VAs . . .
[voice host-50]
For Pacifica: You are new to town, what do you think of it and its citizens so far? How do you think the town is treating you guys so far?
[CHARF Xbox set unsure]
[voice host-51]
. . . Am I reading that correctly? . . . Yes, I am.

[CHARF Aki set thinking]
[voice aki-07]
Um . . . hm.
[voice aki-08]
Um, I believe Gideon is more new to the town then-
[CHARF Aki set unclear]
[voice aki-09]
Do you want me to answer as Pacifica? I’ll just answer as Pacifica.
[CHARF Aki set happy]
[voice aki-10]
I think Gideon’s more new to the town than I am, cause I do show him around and stuff, but um, I really like the town, honestly. 
[CHARF Aki set critical]
[voice aki-11]
Just some of the people aren’t great.

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-52]
Alright . . .
[voice host-53]
And for . . . Dipper: What do you think of the new people in town? Also, how’s your relationship with your sister Mabel?

[CHARF Ethan set cheeky]
[voice ethan-07]
Well . . . I am a huge fan of new people coming to town; more new friends, y’know, brightens things up a little bit.
[voice ethan-08]
 But . . . the relationship of my sister and I, I would say we’re quite close as most siblings are, but I’m not one to show and tell too much - just enough.

[CHARF Xbox set unsure]
[voice host-54]
Well, that’s . . . great. 
[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-55]
Now for Pacifica, “Who is your favorite person in Reverse Falls so far?”

[CHARF Aki set thinking]
[voice aki-12]
Umm . . . well, I don’t have a lot of friends in Reverse Falls, so I’d probably say Gideon.

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-56]
Okay . . .
[voice host-57]
Dipper, now if you don’t mind, I will call you Mason for this one bit.
[voice host-58]
What do you think of Will Cipher?

[CHARF Ethan set cheeky]
[voice ethan-09]
Well . . . I do have lots of-
[voice ethan-10]
I-I don’t want to boast or anything, I consider myself a bit humble, but . . .
[voice ethan-11]
It is a friend of mine . . . We like to play a lot of, like my sister and I love to play a lot of games - sorry, I don’t want to say at, but with it, y’know.
[voice ethan-12]
Sometimes friends tease a little bit, so it’s all in good fun.

[CHARF Xbox set unsure]
[voice host-59]
That’s understandable . . .
[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-60]
Now, this is gonna be a bit of an insult to you Dipper . . . This one person called you “nerd.” Not just “a nerd.” Just nerd. 

[CHARF Ethan set angry]
[voice ethan-13]
Oh . . .
[voice ethan-14]
I’m - to be quite honest, I’m appalled that someone would call me this, or even insult me.
[voice ethan-15]
I would hope to have the decency to be nice to everyone, but sure, I might be . . . a bit smart, cunning, nice with my words, but definitely not one of those nerds, that’s for sure.

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-61]
Beautifully put.
[voice host-62]
Pacifica, is there a place you’d really like to visit?

[CHARF Aki set thinking]
[voice aki-13]
Mm . . . 
[CHARF Aki set happy]
[voice aki-14]
I don’t know a specific place, but if I’d want to go anywhere, it’s a place with a lot of adventure.
[CHARF Aki set thinking]
[voice aki-15]
Ummm . . . I don’t know.
[voice aki-16]
It’s a hard question . . . lemme think.
[CHARF Aki set idle]
[voice aki-17]
Yeah, I don’t know, that’s a hard question, sorry.

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-63]
There’s no worries.
[voice host-64]
So Dipper . . . so you need to answer this question for your sister, here.
[voice host-65]
“Do you know how long Mabel has known Candy?”

[CHARF Ethan set cheeky]
[voice ethan-16]
Now . . . that is a very good question.
[voice ethan-17]
Honestly, as far back as I could remember, but who knows . . . As I’ve said, my sister does have a decent amount of friends, so I would not want to be rude, but I might be mixing people up.
[voice ethan-18]
But . . . if so, I do apologize. 

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-66]
Now, Pacifica, if you don’t mind answering this question for Gideon . . .
[voice host-67]
Do you know his relationship with Mabel?

[CHARF Aki set thinking]
[voice aki-18]
Mm, not really. 
[voice aki-19]
I believe they met once, but I’m not sure what their relationship is . . .
[CHARF Aki set disappointed]
[voice aki-20]
. . . sorry.
[CHARF Aki set idle]

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-68]
No worries. Dipper, answer this question for Mabel.
[voice host-69]
Do you know - “Mabel, who’s the person you love most besides Dipper and your family?”

[CHARF Ethan set idle]
[voice ethan-19]
Oooh, that is a- that’s quite tricky to be honest, because, siblings. Y’know, we have such a great bond. 
[voice ethan-20]
I couldn’t imagine her liking anyone more than me, or just, anyone else in town. 
[voice ethan-21]
So . . . that’s a hard one - I might have to ask her that.

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-70]
I mean, yeah, that makes sense.
[voice host-71]
Pacifica, what is your favorite videogame?

[CHARF Aki set happy]
[voice aki-21]
I really like open-world games that you can do a lot of adventuring in, and a lot of exploration. 
[voice aki-22]
I don’t know if I have a favorite . . . but yeah, just a lot of exploration. Heh, open world maps, lots of fun stuff.

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-72]
Yeah, that’s great.
[voice host-73]
Now . . . we will close off with one more question.
[voice host-74]
Dipper, how is your relationship with your uncle Stanford?

[CHARF Ethan set cheeky]
[voice ethan-22]
Now, if I think about my family for a second, I know I’m quite close with my sister obviously. I’ve mentioned her a lot, which, I would’ve liked to mention myself a little bit more, but you know, I am gracious.
[CHARF Ethan set idle]
[voice ethan-23]
Ha . . . y’know, I would never want to get into too much family specifics. I would never want to air out any dirty laundry between family members or anything, so . . .
[voice ethan-24]
Maybe that’s just for everyone to see. 
[CHAR hide all]

[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-75]
Right . . .
[voice host-76]
Now, let’s conclude this questions and answers video.
[voice host-77]
Uh, directors - so I’ve heard there’s a little bit of a thing called an ARG you’re working on . . .

[CHARF Grig set sheepish]
[voice grig-74]
Oh god . . . [CHARF Rune set laugh]
[voice grig-75]
[CHAR hide Rune] Uh . . . the ARG exists. You guys still haven’t solved it . . .
[voice grig-76]
I’m honestly surprised none of y’all bothered to go looking in places other than the ones we explicitly pointed out to you.
[voice grig-77]
It’s an alternate reality event . . . so, y’know, there is material out there. It’s linked to us. You just have to go find out.

[CHARF Xbox set smile]
[voice host-78]
Well, I can awfully say that . . . the directors are honestly disappointed in all of you. Try-try a little bit better. Maybe you’ll find the answer you need. 

[CHARF Grig set laugh]
[voice grig-78]
Why-why ever would you say that? [CHARF Rune set laugh]
[CHARF Rune set smile]

[CHARF Xbox set smile]
[voice host-79]
Oh . . . well . . .
[CHAR hide Xbox]

[CHARF Morgan set teasing]
[voice morgan-20]
It’s okay player, you can do it!

[CHARF Rune set laugh]
[voice rune-27]
We believe in you! Just look a little deeper!
[CHAR hide Rune]

[CHARF Grig set smile]
[voice grig-79]
I didn’t spend months planning this thing for nobody to find it!

[CHARF Xbox set smile]
[voice host-80]
Before we conclude this entire video, give them one hint, at least.

[CHARF Grig set smile]
[voice grig-80]
Uhh . . .

[CHARF Rune set smile]
[voice rune-28]
A little scrap of something.

[CHARF Grig set smile]
[voice grig-81]
The tiniest little scrap - I suppose I could do that.
[CHARF Grig set idle]
[voice grig-82]
Uh . . . You’ve all seen the picture, you’ve all gone to the discord.
[voice grig-83]
There are more places that are tied to us - places where we give you information, we give you videos. We give you little nods and hints, and tits and tats. 
[voice grig-84]
Why are you looking in one of them?
[CHARF Grig set smile]
[voice grig-85]
Good enough?

[CHARF Xbox set smile]
[voice host-81]
Yes, that’s . . . good enough for the player.
[CHARF Xbox set serious]
[voice host-82]
But unfortunately, this is where we must conclude. 
[voice host-83]
Now please everyone, say your goodbyes as we sign off.

[CHARF Morgan set smile]
