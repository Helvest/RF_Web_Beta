[C Pacifica set cheeky show from outright flip]

Yeesh… Awkward….
 
[F Pacifica]
Well, that was unexpected… But that’s another thing I love about this diner. Everyone has a different story to tell! There are so many unique people that come here, and it’s usually great if we want to gather information. Just listen around… 
 
//Pacifica and Gideon will stay on screen, perhaps with a suddenly intrigued/interested expression.

By the way Tyler, did you see the weird electrical storm last night at the start of the pine forest?
 
[CF show Tyler set perplexed from outleft]
No, I was busy looking for my clothes actually. 
 
[Incognito]
Your… clothes? 
 
[CF Tyler set frustrated]
Yeah, don’t laugh, but I think someone stole a bunch of my clothes. I was drying them on the clothesline in my garden yesterday when they disappeared. Luckily, I never wash my cap, so that’s something they’re not going to get to that easily!
 
[Incognito]
Dude, that’s kind of disgusting…
You think it might’ve been one of those hobos that people have been talking about lately? Apparently, we got a ton that suddenly moved into town. 
 
[CF Tyler set thinking]//(puzzled)
That is so weird… 
 
[Incognito]
Then again, we shouldn’t be too surprised.
The Falls are full of strange occurrences. 
 
[CF Tyler set sigh]
Very true… 
 
[CF Pacifica set happy show from outright]
Mister Tyler! 
 
[CF Gideon set surprised show from outright]//(shocked)
Hey! What are you doing? 
 
[F Pacifica]
Could we investigate the place where your clothes were stolen? We’d like to help out. 
 
[CF Tyler set perplexed]//(suspicious)
Eh… My house is locked so you two can’t steal anything. Sure, whatever. I live on the third street after the laser tag building. 
 
[CF Gideon set anxious]
Wait a second! 
 
[CF Pacifica set joyful]
Thank you sir! 
 
[CF Tyler set annoyed]
Though if you mess anything up, I’ll get you… 
 
[C Tyler hide outleft]


[CF Gideon set confused]
Wow, wow! Slow down there Pacifica! We haven’t even gotten our food yet. 
 
[CF Pacifica set confident]//(excited)
We’re going to investigate! Food is best served after hard work. We can come back later!
 
[CF Gideon set angry]//(upset)
You wake me up and tempt me with all that food and now you’re dragging me out before I can even have a bite?
How could you?!
 
[CF Pacifica set cheeky]
Come on, it’ll be fun!
Imagine how cool it will be once we uncover all of this town’s secrets, we might even find a lead on the Blue Dorito!

[C Pacifica set thinking]
Although I'm still unsure about what to do first…
 
[CF Gideon set disappointed]
Wait, I still haven't agreed to this!
Let's talk about this over…
[CF Gideon set thinking]
…over food?
 
[CF Pacifica set joyful]
Nope! So which one do you think we should go to first?
 
[F Gideon]//(shocked)
Stop deciding things without me!
