[CHARF Gideon set unclear show from outright]
[CHAR Pacifica set cheeky show from outright flip]

Yeesh... Awkward...


[Pacifica]
Well that was unexpected...
But that's just another thing I love about this diner.
Everyone has a different story to tell!
There are so many unique people that come here and it's usually great if we want to gather information.
Just listen around...


//Pacifica and Gideon will stay on screen, perhaps with a suddenly intrigued/interested expression.

...By the way Tyler, did you see the weird electrical storm last night at the start of the pine forest?

[CHAR show Tyler from outleft]
[CHARF Tyler set perplexed]
No, I was busy looking for my clothes actually.


[Incognito]
Your... Clothes?


[CHARF Tyler set frustrated]
Yeah, don't laugh but I think someone stole a bunch of my clothes.
I was drying them on the clothesline in my garden, but when I came back an hour later to check on them they were gone.
I luckily never wash my cap, so that's something they're not going to get to that easily!


[Incognito]
Dude, that's kind of disgusting...
You think it might've been one of those hobos that people have been talking about lately?
Apparently we got a ton that suddenly moved into town.


[CHARF Tyler set thinking]
That is super weird...


[Incognito]
Then again we shouldn't be too surprised.
The Falls are full of strange occurrences.


[CHARF Tyler set sigh]
Very true...

[CHAR show Pacifica from outright]
[CHARF Pacifica set happy]
Mister Tyler!

[CHAR show Gideon from outright]
[CHARF Gideon set surprised]
Hey! What are you doing?


[CHARF Pacifica set happy]
Could we investigate the place where your clothes were stolen? We'd like to help out.


[CHARF Tyler set perplexed]
Eh... My house is locked so you two can't steal anything. So sure whatever.
I live on the third street after the laser tag building.


[CHARF Gideon set anxious]
Wait a second!


[CHARF Pacifica set joyful]
Thank you sir!


[CHARF Tyler set annoyed]
Though if you mess anything up, I'll get you…


[CHAR Tyler hide outleft]
[CHARF Gideon set confused]
Whoa, whoa! Slow down there Pacifica! We haven't even gotten our food yet.


[CHARF Pacifica set confident]
We're going to investigate! Food is best served after hard work. We can come back later!


[CHARF Gideon set angry]
You wake me up and tempt me with all that food and now you're dragging me out before I can even have a bite?
How could you?!


[CHARF Pacifica set cheeky]
Come on, it'll be fun!
Imagine how cool it will be once we uncover all of this town's secrets, we might even find a lead on the Blue Dorito!
Although I'm still unsure about what to do first...


[CHARF Gideon set disappointed]
Wait, I still haven't agreed to this!
Let's talk about this over...
...over food?


[CHAR Gideon set idle]
[Pacifica]
Nope! So which one do you think we should go to first?
