You have got to be kidding me.
I made my dad angry, just for this?!
He's going to murder me when I get home!


[CHARF Pacifica set cheeky]
Not just any food, my dear Gideon. //Add tsk sound effect
This is top quality breakfast, one of a kind in Reverse Falls!


[CHARF Gideon set skeptical]
Considering the size of this town I doubt it'd be hard to find.


[CHARF Pacifica set unclear]
Don't be grumpy... Just take a look at the menu!

The two enter at the diner and take a seat by the counter.

Alright... What do you two want... ?


[CHARF Gideon set anxious]

[Pacifica]
And the usual pancakes for me!
With lots of whipped cream please!

Are you sure? I don't mind paying.


[CHARF Pacifica set joyful]
Yeah, it'd be my pleasure! to commemorate our newfound friendship and all.


[CHARF Gideon set happy]
Wow that's... that's actually really kind of you.
Thanks...


[CHARF Pacifica set happy]
Don't sweat it, after all I love making my friends happy!
Though... I haven't really been making a lot of friends around here, so I'm super happy I can call you my friend!.
Plus I still need your help hunting down that thing from yesterday!


[CHARF Gideon set embarrassed]
Right, so...
What should we do about that little blue dorito?
Didn't you want to catch him?


[CHARF Pacifica set joyful] 
Yup, but I'm not really sure how to start just yet...
So we should figure out a plan after we've eaten.
After all, the best ideas come once you've eaten lots of sugar...
...or something like that.


[Narrator]
There is a sudden amount of commotion in the diner.

[CHAR Pacifica flip]
[???]
No!!! That ascot was a gift!
You can't just replace it like that!
I just can't deal with you anymore...
We're through!


[Scot]
But... But Linda!
It wasn't my fault! Some weird monster destroyed it!


[???]
Who would actually believe that?!
You're such an ass, Scot!

[Scot]
Linda! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

[Linda]
We're through!

[Narrator]
The woman stands up and quickly leaves the dinner, a stifling silence left in her wake.
