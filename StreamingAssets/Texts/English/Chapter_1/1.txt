Gideon! It’s Pacifica! The girl you met yesterday, rememb-?

[Sound right door_open]
[Narrator]
Abruptly, the door swings open with a distressed Gideon standing in the doorway.


[CHARF Gideon set scared show from outleft]
Pacifica! Shhh!


[Pacifica]
Oh, hey Gideon! What’s up? You answer the door fast! Usually it takes me a whole minute to get to it-

[Gideon]
Pacifica, please, you need to leave before-

[Voice Bud_Boy_1]
GIDEON!!!
WHO IS AT THE DOOR THIS EARLY IN THE MORNING? 
IT BETTER NOT BE THE POLICE!


[CHARF Pacifica set perplexed]
Gideon, is that your dad?


[Gideon]
Yeah, but there’s no need to-


[CHARF Pacifica set confident]
HELLO SIR, I AM JUST PICKING GIDEON UP FOR THE DAY!


[Bud]
IS THAT A GIRL’S VOICE?!


[CHARF Gideon set anxious]
On second thought, I’ll come with you. Just as long as it’s far, far away and we don’t come back for a couple of hours.


[CHARF Pacifica set happy]
Sure! I’ll take you someplace that’ll blow your mind...


[CHARF Gideon set idle]
Yeah, whatever. Let’s just get out of here first.


//The two start moving away and the scenery changes into the town.

Sooo, your dad seemed like a really nice guy!
Why did we have to leave so fast?


[CHARF Gideon set anxious]
Ah... He can just get a little... weird, about... Surprise guests.
You... eh, should call before you come over next time.


[CHARF Pacifica set disappointed]
Oh...


[CHARF Gideon set embarrassed]
Ahem... So where are we going?
Please don’t tell me you just found some rare bird’s nest or something weird...


[CHARF Pacifica set happy]
Pfft! Who do you think I am? No, no. I have something far better.


[CHARF Gideon set anxious]
I’m getting worried...


[CHARF Pacifica set happy]
Did you eat breakfast?


[CHARF Gideon set confused]
Of course not! It’s really early!


[CHARF Pacifica set perplexed]
It’s actually 10 am... But your answer was perfect!


[CHARF Gideon set confused]
Wait a minute... Are you taking me out for breakfast?


[CHARF Pacifica set confident]
Hehe, yep! And here we are!
By the way, did you know that this place has the most amazing pancakes...?
Melting chocolate chip bliss, with a fresh drop of whipped cream and a juicy cherry on top...
