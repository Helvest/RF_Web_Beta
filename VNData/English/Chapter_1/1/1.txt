[F narrator]
[Sound right door_open]
Abruptly, the door swings open with a distressed Gideon standing in the doorway.

//Have gideon slide in
[CF Gideon set scared show from outleft]//(worried)
Pacifica! <size=120%>Shhh!

[F pacifica]
Oh, hey Gideon! What’s up? You answered the door fast! Usually it takes me a whole minute to get to it… 

[F gideon]//(worried)
Pacifica, please just go before-

//Bud doesn’t appear on screen.

[F bud]
BOY!!!
WHO IS AT THE DOOR THIS EARLY IN THE MORNING? IT BETTER NOT BE THE POLICE!

[CF pacifica set perplexed]//(curious)
Gideon, is that your dad? 

[F gideon]//(scared)
Yes, but no need to-

[CF pacifica set confident]//(shouting happily)
HELLO SIR, I AM JUST PICKING GIDEON UP FOR THE DAY!

[F bud]
IS THAT A GIRL’S VOICE?! 

[CF gideon set anxious]//(scared)
On second thought, I’ll come with you as long as it’s far, far away and we don’t come back for at least a couple hours.

[CF pacifica set happy]//(smiling)
Sure! I’ll take you someplace that’ll blow your mind… 

[CF gideon set idle]
Yeah, whatever. Let’s just get out of here first.

//The two start moving away and the scenery changes into the town.

Sooo… Your dad seemed like a really nice guy! Why did we have to leave so fast?

[CF gideon set anxious]//(nervous)
Ah… He just gets a little weird about… surprise guests. You should call before you come over next time.

[CF pacifica set disappointed]//(concerned)
Oh… 

[CF gideon set embarassed]//(blush)
Ahem… So where are we going? 
Please don’t tell me you just found some rare bird’s nest or something weird… 

[CF pacifica set happy]
Pfft! Who do you think I am? No, no. I have something far better. 

[CF gideon set anxious]
I’m getting worried… 

[CF pacifica set happy]
Did you eat breakfast? 

[CF gideon set confused]
Of course not! It’s really early!

[CF pacifica set perplexed]
It’s actually only 10 am… But your answer was perfect! 

[CF gideon set confused]//(shocked)
Wait a minute… Are you taking me out for breakfast? 

[CF pacifica set confident]
Hehe, yep! And here we are!
By the way, did you know that this place has the most amazing pancakes...?
Melting chocolate chip bliss with a fresh drop of whipped cream and juicy cherry on top...
