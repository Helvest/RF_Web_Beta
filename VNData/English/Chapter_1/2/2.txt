You have got to be kidding me. I made my dad angry, just for this?!
He's going to murder me when I get home!

[CF pacifica set cheeky]
Not just any food, my dear Gideon. This is top quality breakfast, one of a kind in Reverse Falls! 

[CF gideon set skeptical]//(exasperated)
Considering the size of this town it mustn't be very hard to find. 

[CF pacifica set unclear]
Don’t be grumpy… Take a look at the menu!

[CF gideon set shocked]
If you think a menu is going to-[CF gideon set confused] Hey, they have cake flavored pizza!
 
[CF pacifica set joyful]
Hehe, told you so! Order anything you’d like, it’s on me.
 
[CF gideon set perplex]

The two enter at the diner and take a seat by the counter.

//Livia slides in. She has both her eyes wide open and is looking at them while buzzing with energy.

“Babbling too fast to understand”

[CF Gideon set confused]//confused
What?

[F Pacifica] 
Gideon, let me present to you the waitress of the Under the Rock,  “Active” Livia. Active Livia, here is my new friend, Gideon Pines.

[F Gideon] //confused
Nice to meet… you?

[CF Livia set happy] 
“More babbling too fast to understand”

[F Gideon]//whispering
<size=80%>Why is she talking so fast?

[CF Pacifica set thinking]//sweatdrop expression
She REALLY likes espresso, so much so that she even invented a way of duplicating her amount of caffeíne per cup.

[CF gideon set shocked]//baffled
How??

[F Livia]
“Even more babbling too fast to understand”

[CF gideon set annoyed]
And isn’t there a way of making her calm down so I can understand what she’s saying?

[CF pacifica set happy]
Yep, we just have to say the magic words.
[CF pacifica set joyful]
Hey, Livia!

[CF Livia set joyful]
Yeah?

[F pacifica]
Can I have a “Sleeping Beauty”?

[F Livia] 
“Babbling too fast” Sure!

[C Livia hide]
//Livia’s sprite leaves.

[CF gideon set idle]
What’s a “Sleeping Beauty?”

[CF pacifica set happy]
It’s a triple ​​chamomile tea with a touch of sleeping pills.

[F gideon]
Whoa.

[CF pacifica set cheeky]
Yeah, I plan to mix it with her “Death Wish” coffee.

[CF gideon set unclear]//baffled
Death wish coffee?

[CF pacifica set idle]
Oh! Shh! Here she comes!

//Livia’s sprite comes in.
[C Livia show to center]
[F narrator]
Livia comes in with a large cup of tea that she places on the table. In her other hand rests her own coffee, which she takes a sip of as she places Pacifica’s order down.

[F Livia] 
“Babbling too fast to understand”

[CF pacifica set happy]
Oh, hey! Look at that! What’s that behind you?
Huh? What? 
//Sprite flips.
[CF Livia flip set idle]
Where?

[F pacifica]
Yeah, it’s right there, can’t you see it? 

[F narrator]
Pacifica quickly pours the tea into Livia’s mug hurriedly, right before she turns back around.

//Livia’s sprite flips back.
[C Livia flip]

[F pacifica]
Ohhh, It’s gone! I’m so sorry that you couldn't see it!

[CF Livia set joyful] 
”babbles a bit more”

[F narrator]
Livia proceeds to take another sip of her coffee.

[CF gideon set perplex]
//whispering
How long does it take to have an effect?

[CF pacifica set idle]
//whispering
<size=80%>3… 2… 1…[C Livia set blank]

[F Livia]
Whoa… Is it just me or is the world moving so much faster now?

[CF pacifica set happy]
Nah, it’s just you. So what were you saying before the thing showed up?

[F Livia]
The what?

[F pacifica]
The thing, the thing that made you turn around?

[CF Livia set happy]
Oh right, I was saying that I really shouldn’t legally sell you the “Sleeping Beauty”, due to its components.

[CF gideon set idle]
So why did you sell it anyway?

[F Livia]
Oh, because I knew that Pacifica wouldn’t tell anyone, I trust her, and I would do the same for her if she needed me to keep a secret.

[CF pacifica set confident]//tearful
Awww!

[CF gideon set shocked]//whispering
<size=80%>Oh, god, that’s so illegal.

[CF Livia set joyful]
Alright, do you two want to order anything else? 
 
[CF gideon set anxious]
Uhhh… The cake flavored pizza please. Extra um… sprinkles?
 
[CF pacifica set happy]
And the usual pancakes for me!
Lots of whipped cream please!
 
[CF Livia hide]//smiling
Coming right up.
 
//She leaves.

[CF gideon set idle]
You two seem to know each other very well.

[F pacifica]
Of course we do! She’s the nearest thing I have to a bestie.
 
[CF gideon set thinking]//submissive
I see . . .
Are you sure about paying for our meal? 

[CF pacifica set joyful]
Yeah, it’d be my pleasure! To commemorate our newfound friendship and all. 

[CF gideon set happy]//(smiling)
Wow that’s… that’s actually really kind of you. Thanks…

[CF pacifica set happy]
Don’t sweat it, I love making my friends happy! I haven’t been making many around here, so it’s honestly nice.
Plus, I still need your help hunting down that thing from yesterday!

[CF gideon set embarassed]//(blush)
Right, so… What should we do about that little blue dorito? Didn’t you want to capture him?

[CF pacifica set joyful]
Yup, but I’m not really sure how to start just yet.. We should figure out a plan after we’ve eaten.
After all, [Sound hit_on_table][Screen shake]the best ideas come once you've eaten lots of sugar… Or something like that.

[C Pacifica flip]

There is a sudden commotion in the diner.

[F scot]
But… But mi Linda!
It wasn’t my fault! Some weird monster destroyed it!
 
[CF rosanna set furious]
Who would actually believe that?!
You're such an ass, Scot!

[CF scot set scared]//(horrified)

The woman stands up and quickly leaves the dinner, a stifling silence left in her wake.
